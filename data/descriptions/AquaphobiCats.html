You are an Alien!<br>
You have come to earth bearing the gifts of your people for our planet's most intelligent creatures.<br>
<br>
You quickly introduce yourself to the cats of the planet.<br>
<br>
Worried that they will lose their comfortable lifestyle if you share their secrets, they throw you into a volcano to destroy you with your one weakness, lava.<br> <br>

Use your Spray Bottle to stay alive as long as you can by jumping and launching yourself to rocky platforms, battling cats and their yarnballs as you go.
