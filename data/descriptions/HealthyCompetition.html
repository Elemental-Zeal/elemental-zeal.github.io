Made for Ludum Dare 45.<br>

It's the annual master wizard chef competition! Wizard chefs from all around the globe compete in order to be ranked the new 5-star master wizard chef.<br>
Contests race race to select their top of the line weapon to help them out in the ingredients dungeon.<br>
Unfortunately, you get trampled and before you can get up all the weapons are taken. Looks like you're going to have to start this challenge with nothing.
